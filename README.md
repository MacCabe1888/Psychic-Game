# Psychic-Game
A guessing game powered by JavaScript.

This simple guessing game gives you nine chances each round to guess what letter the computer is "thinking."

* If you guess correctly within nine guesses, you win!
* Otherwise, you lose!
* In either case, a new round will immediately start with a new secret letter for you to guess.

The objective probability of winning a given round is about 1 out of 3. Do you have the psychic prowess (or, at least, dumb luck) needed to beat the odds?
